# Multi-Model Reasoning (MMR)

## Overview

This paper introduces the Multi-Model Reasoning (MMR) system, a conceptual framework designed to achieve a new frontier in artificial intelligence by decoupling the cognitive tasks of reasoning and knowledge recall into two specialized transformer-based models. The system comprises a **Reasoning Model ("Logic Model")** and a **Knowledge Model ("Data Model")**.

The Logic Model is a highly efficient, low-precision (**FP4**) model architected for logic, problem decomposition, and synthesis. The Data Model is a high-precision (**FP8**) model optimized for the dense storage and accurate retrieval of factual information.

By separating these concerns, the Multi-Model Reasoning system aims to produce responses that are both logically sound and factually accurate, overcoming the limitations of monolithic models which often struggle with factual consistency and complex reasoning simultaneously. This paper details the architecture, the inter-model communication protocol, potential training paradigms, and the conceptual foundation of this innovative approach. 

## Summary

Multi-Model Reasoning (MMR) decouples reasoning from knowledge storage. A high-dimensional, low-precision **Logic Model (FP4)** handles reasoning and problem decomposition, while a deep, high-precision **Data Model (FP8)** ensures accurate factual recall. This modular approach aims to deliver responses that are simultaneously logical and factually precise while remaining computationally efficient and easy to update.
